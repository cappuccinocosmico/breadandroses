# Jurassic Park/World Vs. Primer

I have very mixed feelings about the jurrasic park movies, it was one of the movies that had sparked my enthousiasm for science

#### Theme of Jurassic Park & Jurassic World
The theme of jurrasic park is essentialy stated in one of the lines from jeff goldbloom early in the story.

`“Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”`

This is pretty well supported, both from the fact that the dinosours are created by technology and creating them is ultimatly a mistake. To the fact that in the end technology is incapable of holding back these forces of nature.

Now this is where the science in movies problem comes into force.

The problem in the movie that I would like to talk about is how the dinosours behave in these movies.  In Jurassic Park, and expecialy the sequels, they are not really treated any differently from any other monster. They will persue humans across great distances and behave incredibly agressively.

The only slight problem with this is that this wouldnt be how dinosours would behave, if you were going to keep them in captivity.

### Humans as an Extinctionary event.

The whole theme of forbidden knowledge in science

#### Science in Movies

It seems like a lot of movie critisism seems to sidestep the importance of logic in filmmaking.

There is a lot of attention paid to the fact that fictional worlds are by their own definition fictional, and that it doesnt realy matter if its set in its own world as long as it doesnt explicitly contradict itself, and I feel like jurrasic park and its recent sequel jurassic world illustrate an intersection of these ideas. And how many pepole would say that bringing science and logic can actualy bring out the themes in a movie.
