#### Jurassic Park

Add intro about how you liked it as a kid and how you have re-watched it and the sequels, and how over time you have slowly started to realize some big problems with the themes of it.

#### Domination and Sustainability

Probably the most overt theme of jurrasic park is the nature vs man. You see this in a lot of scenes with the one and only jeff goldbloom

The theme of jurrasic park is essentialy stated in one of the lines from jeff goldbloom early in the story.

`“Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.”`





Now there are also a lot of evidence to support the theme of human hubris and humans ascension to godhood. But ultimatly I find those way less intresting then the way that the dinosaurs are portrayed as in oposition to the humans.

In every jurassic park movie the dinosaurs are expecitly coded as a unstopable force of nature, always and eternaly in conflict with the humans in the stories. Every movie will always involve pepole getting eaten by dinosaurs and pepole shooting at dinosaurs with guns. Never is peaceful coexistance with dinosaurs shown as a potential posibily.

If you are slightly curious about some evidence for this all of the pepole who originaly build the parks and advocate solutions like that, are either drastically proven wrong or eaten.



 *possibly insert goldbloom quote about god""*
But whats intresting is that this has a lot in common with
