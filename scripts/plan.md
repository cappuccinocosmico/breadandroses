# Homework and Studdying

Schedule your time
One of the things that many new college students look forward to the most is not having to go to class for seven hours a day. However, while most college students spend an average of 12–18 hours in the classroom each week, the school work definitely doesn’t stop there. The good news is that because you’re not in class for extended periods of time, you can get most of your homework done during the time that you would have been in class in high school. The bad news? It requires a lot more self-discipline to sit down and do homework when you live down the hall, or at the very least across campus, from your friends and lots of fun things to do. However, if you block out this time to do homework, you will have plenty of free time once you finish. Keep in mind that the most important thing here is not that you necessarily work on schoolwork or are in class from 8:00 am to 3:00 pm everyday (which works for many people simply because that’s what they’re used to), but that you block out sufficient time to sit down and work, regardless of when that is, rather than going to class for several hours and spending the rest of your day socializing and watching Netflix.

Take advantage of your professors’ office hours
One of the recurring pieces of advice you might hear from older students when you get to college is to use your professor’s office hours. Take this advice! Especially if you are in a larger class, this allows you to get to know your professor and his or her teaching style a little better, plus your professor can connect your face with a name on the roster. Professors have office hours specifically so that students can come in and ask questions about the course work, the next test, or maybe even what other classes to take if you have found their class enjoyable. It may seem intimidating to sit down with a professor at first, but it’s always important to remember that your professors are people too!


# Attendance

I assume the desired effect of an attendance policy is to help students get the most out of their education and graduate prepared for their profession. It's not the university's job to ensure a student's success though; it's the individuals.

We aren't allowing students to discover what failure looks like. We're teaching them to attribute lack of success on their transcripts to attendance instead of taking responsibility for not studying or absorbing information. College attendance policies do not allow for students to sink or swim on their own.

In high school, attendance policies are necessary. High school is a time where our creativity is often stifled in an effort to pump us full of basic knowledge, so a lack of motivation is common. This is part of the reason why students are excited to graduate and go to college, where they have the ability to choose their paths and take classes that interest them.

If a student is at the point where they've had their pick of courses and they still aren't attending classes, it's their responsibility to to reevaluate whether college is right for them at all. It is not a university's job to force them to attend.

Faculty Associate at the Walter Cronkite School, Peter Madrid said students attendance is important so that they don't miss information.

"Those policies are in place for a certain reason. You miss a class period and chances are you've missed an assignment," Madrid said. 

"At this point, you're college students, you have to start learning to manage your time and a big part of that is attending your classes and making that a priority."

If a student is missing frequent class periods, it's safe to say they are missing significant amounts of material. This will translate in their test scores and inability to relay important information in class presentations or research papers. You can only fake knowledge for so long.
